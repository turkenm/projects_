# README

This project is created for image recognition task on CIFAR10 dataset with 3-CNN Layer. 

## Required Libraries and Versions

* Python Version: 3.7.10
* TensorFlow Version: 2.5.0
* Keras Version: 2.5.0
* Numpy Version: 1.19.5

## main.py

Main.py consist of:
- Loading data set
- Data augmentation steps
- Train function
- Test function 
- Training loop

## model.py
Model.py consist of:
- Networks layer functions
- Weights initializers
- CNN model

## eval.py
Eval.py consist of:
- loading weights and testing model

P.S: All project prepeared on the Google Colab notebooks in order to utilize Google computers that have high computational power. If your computer is not sufficient for deep learning training, it is not recommended to run main.py. You can face with memory problems. I also put the link of Colab Notebook that all project works properly.
