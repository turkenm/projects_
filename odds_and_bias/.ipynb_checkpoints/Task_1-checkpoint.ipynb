    "Football matches can end in three different outcomes: the home team wins, the away team wins, and the match ends in a draw. Betting companies analyze the probabilities for these three different results according to many parameters such as the form of the teams, the form of the players, the statistics of the previous matches and determine a rate for each result. For example, let's say that a bookmaker sets the home, draw and away team odds as 1.30 - 4.70 - 6.80 respectively for the match result bet. In other words, for every 1 unit of money played, the betting company will pay the player 1.30 units if the home team wins the match, 4.70 units if it ends in a draw, and 6.80 units if the guest team wins. The probability of occurrence of events at these rates determined according to the results of the analysis can be found by using the formula p = 1 / Ratio. According to these determined rates, the probability of the home team to win is 1 / 1.30 = 0.769, the probability of the match to end in a draw is 1 / 4.70 = 0.213, the probability of the away team to win is 1 / 6.80 = 0.147. If we add these three possibilities together, we see that 0.769 + 0.213 + 0.147 = 1.129. According to probability theory, the sum of the probability of occurrence of all events in the sample space is 1. The excess of 0.129 here shows the profit margin of the bookmakers. That is, when betting on all three outcomes with equal payoffs, the player's winnings will be less than the total stake, and thus the bookmaker will make a profit regardless of the outcome of the match."
